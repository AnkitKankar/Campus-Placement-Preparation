# Campus-Placement-Preparation

# Introduction (&#x1F4D7;) : 

Every IT students have dreamed of getting placed in the good company, but very few are able to make it. Because they are 
unable to crack coding round and interview, sometime fails in aptitude round too. The main reason behind this, they don't
follow proper course material and technique. They don't know from where and what have to prepare for campus interview. 
To solve such type of confusion I'm putting some efforts towards it and trying to collect all those important material and 
pdf notes at one place.Hope you will enjoy it. All the best.
